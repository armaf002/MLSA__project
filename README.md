## Project Description

Our project aims to develop a Tomato Disease Classifier App using azure custom vision and azure web app technology. The app targets farmers and agricultural professionals, providing them with a tool for early detection and classification of common tomato diseases. Leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques, the app will assist in identifying diseases promptly, thereby enabling effective disease management and enhancing crop yield and quality.

We chose this project because we recognize the significant impact that tomato diseases can have on agricultural productivity. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for mitigating these impacts. Traditional methods of disease identification are often time-consuming and error-prone. By developing an automated solution using advanced technologies like machine learning and computer vision, we aim to provide farmers with a more efficient and reliable tool for disease detection and management.

Through this project, we hope to contribute to the agricultural sector by empowering farmers with innovative technologies that improve crop health and productivity. Our team is committed to delivering a user-friendly application that meets the needs of our target users while addressing the challenges associated with tomato disease management.
